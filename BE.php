        <h2 class="iit-heading">About Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.)</h2>
        <p class="iit-text">
          Bachelor of Engineering, or B.E., is a professional degree programme of the undergraduate level that is
          dedicated entirely to the field of engineering. The duration of a B.E. programme is four years and it reaches
          up to five years if the student has enrolled in the integrated dual-degree course. The course of B.E. is covered
          semester wise and it is spread evenly across eight (or ten) semesters. Students who pursue their graduation in
          Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) can choose their stream and specialisation from a plethora of options available.
          B.E. is offered in many public and private institutions and each institute provides different subjects for
          specialisation. The main focus of the B.E. course is on the scientific theory concepts and experiments
          which are used later in making it a reality.
        </p>
        <p class="iit-text">
        Students who pursue the course of B.E. are required to work on scientific theories in order to get practical
        solutions. They are involved in planning, designing, production, construction, implementation, testing,
        maintenance, etc. and are not only limited to engineering but are also extended to the branches of technology,
        industries, and business.
      </p>
      <p class="iit-text">
        Bachelor of Engineering is confused with Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) quite often. However, despite belonging to
        the same field, both of these courses are quite different from each other. B.E. is known as plain engineering and
        is knowledge oriented whereas B.Tech is about engineering technology and is mostly skill oriented. The course of
        B.E. can be described as more of theoretical based research which emphasises on the conceptual clarification of
        facts. On the other hand, B.Tech is more of an application of engineering which lays focus on the practical exposure
        of conceptual knowledge. The syllabus of both programmes is the same, more or less.
